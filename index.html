        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Company data was queried directly from the Compustat Annual database through the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS). WRDS is a well-known data provider of business-related data run by the University of Pennsylvania. Although WRDS requires an account to query from their databases, Northeastern students are easily able to apply for an account that is sponsored by the university. The dataset that resulted from our query on WRDS is here(ADD LINK HERE).
        </p>
        <p>There are no bias or ethical considerations present in annual financial reports. These reports go through both internal and independent external auditors with all values checked over many times. With this, all values are guaranteed to be true. However, while annual reports do not reflect false information about the company, we should always read them with a sense of skepticism as companies always want to portray themselves in the best light.
        </p>
        <p>The original dataset contained annual balance sheet information across a range of 13 years for PUT COMPANY LIST HERE from January 2010 to January 2023. After extracting the data from the database, we noticed there were several columns full of missing values.
